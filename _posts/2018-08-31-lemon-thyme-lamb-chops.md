  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Put the lamb chops in a shallow dish and cover with 1/8 cup of oil, the lemon juice, and a couple of tablespoons of thyme leaves.
    1. Cover and let it sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.
    1. Turn the chops over a couple of times to allow all surfaces to marinate.
    1. Preheat a stove top grill pan on high heat for about 5 minutes.
    1. Lower the heat slightly and grill the chops for about 2 to 3 minutes per side.
    1. Don't move them once you put them down so you will get nice grill marks. Grill the lemon alongside the chops.
    1. Serve right away sprinkled with sea salt and more fresh thyme leaves.
