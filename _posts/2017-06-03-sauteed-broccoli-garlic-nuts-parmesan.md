## I- Ingredients for 4 servings:
* 1 lb. broccoli florets (about 5-6 cups);
* 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil;
* 2 Tbsp pine nuts;
* 2 cloves garlic, sliced very thin;
* 1/4 cup chicken stock;
* 1-2 Tbsp fresh grated parmesan cheese;
* Salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste.

## II- Directions:
1. Wash and cut broccoli florets to make each piece about 1 inch wide.
1. Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, add pine nuts and cook 1-2 minutes, until barely starting to color.
1. Add broccoli florets and saute, stirring constantly, until broccoli turns bright green, about 2-3 minutes.
1. Move broccoli and pine nuts to one side of the pan, add the remaining oil and garlic slices and cook until garlic is fragrant about 1 minute.
1. Turn heat up to high, add chicken stock, stir, and cover pan and cook about 2 minutes, or until broccoli is slightly tender.
1. Uncover and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until all the liquid has evaporated and broccoli is fork-tender, about 3-4 minutes longer.
