## I- Ingredients for 2 &#8217;12-inch&#8217; round pizzas
* 1 batch whole wheat pizza dough;
* 4 cups creamy cauliflower sauce;
* 2 large chicken breasts, cooked and shredded;
* 1 cup shredded Mozzarella or other cheese;
* Diced tomatoes;
* Minced fresh parsley;
* Parmesan cheese;
* Salt and pepper;
* Olive oil.

## II- Directions:
1. Prepare the crust. The recipe makes about 2 12-inch round pizzas, 8 Slices each.
1. Preheat the oven to 375F degrees.
1. Divide the sauce between the two pizzas, spreading about 1/2 cups over each unbaked crust.
1. Arrange the chicken evenly over both pizzas and top with a little bit more sauce (about 1/2 cup each).
1. Add the diced tomatoes or any additional toppings.
1. Sprinkle cheese over the two pizzas, about ½ cup for each pizza.
1. Bake for 12 minutes. Turn on the broiler and continue baking for an additional 3-8 minutes, depending on how browned you want the top/crust to be.
1. Wait until the edges of my chicken started to brown and the outer crust was a little more crispy.
1. Serve immediately topped with parsley, additional salt, and pepper, Parmesan cheese, or a drizzle of olive oil.
