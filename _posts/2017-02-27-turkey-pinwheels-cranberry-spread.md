1. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
1. To make the pinwheels, divide cream cheese mixture among 2 large tortillas and spread evenly all the way to the edge. Top with 10 to 12 fresh spinach leaves on each, pressing down slightly so that the leaves stick to the tortillas.
1. Layer with about 6 turkey slices on each then begins tightly rolling the tortillas and wrapping with plastic wrap to keep them together.
1. Refrigerate for about 1 to 2 hours so that the tortillas hold their shape, then gently cut the rolled tortillas into Â½-inch slices. You should yield about 20 to 22 pinwheels total.
