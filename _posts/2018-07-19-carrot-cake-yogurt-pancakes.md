  directions_markdown: "1. First place eggs, carrot, banana and siggi’s vanilla 0%
    nonfat yogurt in a blender.\n1. Blend until creamy or liquefied.\n1. Add in your
    starch, baking powder, spices and vanilla.\n1. Blend again until smooth. \n1.
    Batter should have a pourable smoothie-like consistency.\n1. For thicker pancakes,
    add a bit more tapioca flour/starch.\n1. For crepe-like pancakes, keep starch
    at ½ cup.\n1. Place batter in fridge to set for 30 minutes.\n1. Remove from fridge
    once batter has set.\n1. Heat a skillet to medium high, adding a few teaspoons
    of oil to coat the pan.\n1. Once hot, scoop 1/3 cup batter and pour into the center
    of the pan. The batter will be thin, but easy to flip.\n1. Cook until the edges
    start to brown or the middle starts to bubble, which is usually no more than 2
    minutes.\n1. Flip over and let pancake cook another 1-3 minutes. See notes for
    cooking times.\n1. Remove pancake and place on plate.\n1. Repeat to get seven
    pancakes. All 7 ½ inches wide.\n1. Top pancakes with extra siggi’s vanilla yogurt
    and optional nuts/cacao nibs.\n1. Serve and enjoy :)"
