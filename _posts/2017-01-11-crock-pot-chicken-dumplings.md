## I- Ingredients for 6 Servings:
* 20 oz chicken breast (about 3 large breasts)
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 1 (10.75 oz) can 98% fat-free cream of chicken soup
* 1 (10.75 oz) can 98% fat-free cream of celery soup
* 2 c chicken broth- 99% fat-free, reduced sodium
* 5 canned buttermilk biscuits
* Optional Seasonings: pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, parsley

## II- Directions:
1. Remove visible fat from chicken breasts and place in crock pot. Sprinkle with pepper, garlic powder, and poultry seasoning. Add onions, soups, and broth. Cover and cook on high 3-4 hours or low 6-8.
1. At this point, the chicken is super tender so you can just use your fork to break the breasts up into smaller pieces or you can remove them and shred them. I like to leave them in decent sized chunks because they will break up more whenever your stir them.
1. Flatten biscuits with your fingers and cut them into small strips. I used the smaller junior sized biscuits and cut them into 8 pieces.
1. Drop biscuit pieces into the broth and continue to cook on high for 20-30 more minutes or until cooked through. Sprinkle individual servings with parsley if desired.
1. Serves: 6 (Large servings!)
