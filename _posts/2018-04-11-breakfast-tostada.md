* 2 eggs;
* 1/2 cup grating cheese;
* Salsa (red or green both work fine);

## II- Directions:

1. Fill a cast-iron skillet with enough oil for a tortilla to just be floating and turn to high heat.
1. Fry up a couple tortillas until they are golden-brown and crispy.
1. Dump the oil, then reheat the pan over medium heat.
1. Fry two eggs in the pan, and while they are cooking, reheat your leftover beans in the microwave.
1. Put each of those crisped-up tortillas on a plate and layer some beans on top.
1. Once your eggs are perfectly fried, set them on top of the beans, and throw some cheese, salsa and hot sauce on top.
