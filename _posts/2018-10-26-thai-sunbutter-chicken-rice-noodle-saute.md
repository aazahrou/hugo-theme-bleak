  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Whisk together the SunButter, tamari, fish sauce, honey, lime juice, garlic, and ginger in a large bowl until smooth.
    1. Add the coconut milk and 2 teaspoons of Sriracha, and continue to whisk until combined.
    1. Add additional Sriracha to taste, if desired. Set the sauce aside.
    1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the rice noodles and boil for 3 minutes.
    1. Add the carrot and bell pepper slices to the pot.
    1. Continue boiling the noodles and vegetables for 2-3 minutes longer, until the noodles are al dente, and the vegetables are fork-tender.
    1. Use a measuring cup to remove 1/2 cup of water from the pot and set aside.
    1. Drain the noodles and vegetables and rinse with cold water.
    1. Season the chicken liberally with sea salt.
    1. Set a wok or extra-large skillet over medium-high heat, and pour in the oil.
    1. Once the oil is shimmering, add the chicken to the pan.
    1. Sauté the chicken for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula, until the pieces are golden brown and the chicken is no longer pink on the inside.
    1. Reduce the heat to low.
    1. Add the noodles, vegetables, SunButter sauce, and 2/3 of the chopped scallions to the skillet.
    1. Gently toss everything together with a rubber spatula until the noodles and chicken are evenly coated with sauce. Add the reserved cooking water to the skillet to thin the sauce, if needed.
    1. Transfer the chicken and noodle sauté to a large serving bowl.
    1. Garnish with the remaining chopped scallions, cilantro, and basil.
    1. Squeeze additional lime juice over the top, if desired, and enjoy immediately.
