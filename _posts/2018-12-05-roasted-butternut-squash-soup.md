  directions_markdown: "1. Roast the squash (can do ahead and refrigerate), Preheat
    oven to 375° Cut squash in half lengthwise.\n1. Using a spoon, scoop out and discard
    the seeds and dark orange stringy flesh.\n1. Place squash cut side down on to
    a baking sheet.\n1. Note that you want the squash to lay perfectly flat, so you
    can get some caramelization going for best flavour.\n1. If they won't all lay
    flat, use two baking sheets if necessary and rotate their position in the oven
    half way through roasting.\n1. Roast in pre-heated oven for 60-70 minutes or until
    very soft when you press on the top of the squash.\n1. Remove from oven and using
    a spatula, flip the squash halves over and allow to cool a few minutes.\n1. Using
    a spoon, scoop all the roasted squash flesh out and in to a bowl, being careful
    not to take any of the skin.\n1. Discard squash skins. If making the soup immediately,
    measure out the amount of cooked squash needed for the soup and set aside.\n1.
    Any extra squash can be refrigerated or frozen and used for another purpose. \n1.
    For the soup, In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat.\n1.
    Add diced onion and cook, stirring, until onion has softened and is translucent,
    but not browned.\n1. Add the measured roasted squash.\n1. Add the chicken broth
    and stir to combine well.\n1. Add the fresh thyme sprig.\n1. Bring to a light
    boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, then reduce heat to medium-low
    and allow to simmer, uncovered, for 20-30 minutes to blend the flavours. \n1.
    Remove Thyme Sprig and discard. Using an immersion blender puree the soup well
    until smooth.\n1. In the soup pot, add the maple syrup and the heavy cream to
    the pureed soup.\n1. Stir well to combine and allow to cook over medium-low heat
    a few minutes to warm through.\n1. Taste soup. Add salt as needed and some freshly
    ground pepper.\n1. Maple syrups vary in intensity.\n1. Serve warm garnished with
    drops of heavy cream and fresh thyme leaves."
