    a baking pan that is large enough to have a half inch of space around each chicken
    breast but no more.\n1. Using too large a baking dish can cause the glaze to be
    too shallow in the pan and burn easily.\n1. Place the empty pan in a 425 degree
    oven to heat up while you prepare the glaze.\n\n### Preparing the Glaze:\n  1.
    Melt the butter in a small saute pan.\n  1. Add the garlic and cook for only 30-60
    seconds to soften it.\n  1. Add the honey, Dijon mustard and a pinch of salt and
    pepper.\n  1. Stir well to blend and simmer over medium heat for one or two minutes
    begin to reduce the glaze.\n  1. Lightly season the chicken breasts with salt
    and pepper.\n  1. Remove the hot pan from the oven and place the chicken breasts
    an equal distance apart in the pan.\n  1. Pour the hot glaze evenly over the chicken.\n
