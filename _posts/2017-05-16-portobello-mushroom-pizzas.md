## I- Ingredients for 4 servings:
* 4 large portobello mushroom caps;
* 3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil;
* 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, sliced (or 1 large sliced tomato);
* 2 cups shredded fresh mozzarella;
* 1/2 cup fresh basil, chopped, plus extra for garnish;
* salt and pepper to taste.

## II- Directions:
1. Form 4 small foil rings, then place them on a cookie sheet and put mushroom caps on top.
1. The foil rings will help the mushrooms roast more evenly, and they won’t be sitting in their own juices so they won’t get soggy on the bottom.
1. Drizzle portobello caps with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
1. Sprinkle a handful of mozzarella onto each mushroom cap, then top with a few slices of tomato and a sprinkling of basil. Then finish with another handful of mozzarella.
1. Bake at 375F for 20-25 minutes, until mushrooms have softened and cheese has melted.
1. Garnish with more basil and serve immediately.
