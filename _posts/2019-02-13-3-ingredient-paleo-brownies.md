    1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
    1. Prepare a 9-in. x 9-in. square baking dish by spraying it with cooking spray or rubbing coconut oil around the sides and bottom so the brownies do not stick.
    1. In a large bowl mash the bananas with a fork until smooth.
    1. Add the almond butter and mix until smooth.
    1. Add the cocoa powder and optional cinnamon and blend until no visible cocoa powder is seen.
    1. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and bake for 20 minutes.
    1. Remove from the oven and let cool completely before slicing.
