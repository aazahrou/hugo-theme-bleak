  directions_markdown: "1. Cook pasta according to package instructions. Drain.\n1.
    Reserve some of pasta water.\n1.While the pasta is cooking, prepare shrimp alfredo
    sauce as described in the next steps.  \n1. Heat a large skillet until hot - add
    2 tablespoons of olive oil and immediately add garlic and shrimp.\n1. Cook on
    one side for about 1 minute until pink, on medium-high heat.\n1. Flip the shrimp
    to the other side, sprinkle the top of cooked side of shrimp with dry basil,paprika,
    crushed red pepper flakes, and salt, cook for another 1-2 minutes, occasionally
    stirring, until shrimp is pink on both sides.\n1. Remove the shrimp from the skillet.
    If shrimp is a little undercooked - it's OK because you will continue cooking
    it in the sauce.\n1. To the same, now empty, skillet add sliced mushrooms.\n1.
    Add more olive oil if necessary.\n1. Cook on high heat for about 2 minutes, occasionally
    stirring, until mushrooms become soft and release juices.\n1. Sprinkle with a
    small amount of salt midway through cooking.\nTo the skillet with mushrooms, add
    cooked shrimp.\n1. Immediately add 1 cup half and half.\n1. Bring to boil, add
    all of the cheese (1/2 cup shredded Parmesan and 1/2 cup shredded Mozzarella)
    - bring to boil, then reduce to medium-simmer, and cook, constantly stirring,
    until the cheese melts.\n1. Cover with lid and remove from heat.\n1. Taste, and
    add more salt if needed.\n1. Add cooked and drained pasta from step 1 to the skillet
    with shrimp and mushrooms and cream sauce.\n1. Reheat on medium heat.  Stir well.\n1.
    If the cream sauce is too thick and you want it thinner - add some pasta water
    in small amounts to the cream sauce (while the sauce is simmering on low-medium
    heat) until you reach desired consistency.\n1. Season with more salt and add more
    crushed red pepper flakes and basil, if desired."
