## I- Ingredients For 4 Servings:
* 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts
* ½ cup whole wheat flour
* ¼ teaspoon black pepper
* ⅓ cup honey mustard
* 2 egg whites, beaten
* ½ cup panko breadcrumbs
* ½ cup salted pretzels (small sticks)

## II- Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with foil. Spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.
1. Place the chicken in between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and pound the chicken breasts out into 4 thin pieces with a meat mallet.
1. On a rimmed plate or shallow dish, stir the flour, salt, and black pepper together. In another shallow dish, combine the honey mustard and beaten egg whites. 
1. In a food processor, pulse the pretzels a few times, until they are a coarse bread crumb consistency. Transfer them to another rimmed plate and mix with the panko crumbs.
1. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture and shake off the excess. Then, dip them in the egg/mustard mixture and allow the excess to drip off before coating the chicken in the panko/pretzel mixture.
1. Place the coated chicken on the set-aside baking sheet and bake for 16-20 minutes.
