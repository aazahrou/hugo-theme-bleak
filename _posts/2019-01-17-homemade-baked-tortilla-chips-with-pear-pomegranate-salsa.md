    1. **The Tortilla Chips:**
        1. Make sure the oven racks are in the middle of the oven.
        1. Turn oven on to 375 degrees and allow to preheat.
        1. Lay tortillas out on a work surface and cut into quarters.
        1. Spray the tortillas lightly with the cooking oil, flip and spray the other side.
        1. Get out a couple large baking sheets or cookie sheets and lay the tortillas out on the sheets, avoiding any over-lapping.
        1. Bake in preheated oven for about 15 minutes, turning the tortilla pieces over with a tongs about half way through. They should become golden brown and crispy as they bake and will even crisp up more after you remove them from the oven.
        1. Remove and immediately sprinkle with the sea salt or any other flavorings you like while the chips are still warm.
    1. **The Pear and Pomegranate Salsa:**
        1. In a medium bowl combine all of the ingredients and stir until well combined.
        1. Serve right away with Tortilla Chips or refrigerate until ready.
