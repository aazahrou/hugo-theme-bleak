## I- Ingredients for 4 servings:

* 2 large apples cut into 2 mm (1/8&#8243;) thick slices;
* 2 tsp ground cinnamon.

## II- Directions:

1. Preheat your oven to 250F degrees.
1. Cut the apple vertically around the core and discard the core.
1. Using a mandolin, sharp knife or food processor attachment, thinly slice the apples vertically, trying to keep the slices the same thickness (2 mm thickness or 1/8 of an inch, or setting 3 on your food processor).
1. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place your apple slices on the sheets in a single layer and sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake your apple slices for 1 hour or until crisp.
1. If they are still a bit moist after 1 hour, flip them over and keep checking every 15 minutes.
1. Let your apple chips cool completely and enjoy with Honey Nut Yogurt Dip! If you have any leftovers that day, store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
