  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Cover the cashews with water in a bowl and soak for 2 hours.
    1. Drain and rinse thoroughly. Place in a food processor or blender and add the 3/4 cup water, salt, and garlic.
    1. Puree until very smooth.
    1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat.
    1. Add the sweet potatoes; toss in the pan for 6-7 minutes with tongs until tender-crisp.
    1. Remove from heat and toss in the spinach – it should wilt pretty quickly.
    1. Add half of the herbs and half of the sauce to the pan and toss to combine.
    1. Add water if the mixture is too sticky.
    1. Season generously with salt and pepper, drizzle with olive oil, and top with the remaining fresh herbs.
