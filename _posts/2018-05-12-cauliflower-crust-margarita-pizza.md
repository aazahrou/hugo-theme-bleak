## I- Ingredients for 2 servings:

* 1 (2-pound) head cauliflower, stem removed and florets into pieces;
* 1/2 cup water;
* 1 large egg;
* 1 tsp salt;
* 1/4 cup marinara sauce;
* Pinch of crushed red pepper;
* 4 ounces of mini mozzarella balls or shredded mozzarella;
* Fresh basil, for topping.

## II- Directions:

1. To a food processor, add the florets and pulse until the cauliflower resembles “rice.”
1. Add the cauliflower rice to a medium saucepan along with the water.
1. Set over medium low heat and cook for 10 minutes until cauliflower is very soft and tender. Transfer to the center of a few sheets of cheesecloth or a towel.
1. Allow to cool for a bit.
1. Squeeze the cauliflower rigorously until it no longer leeches water.
1. More water will come out than you think! Place it in the empty saucepan you used or a bowl.
1. Mix in the egg and salt.
1. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
1. Spread the cauliflower mixture into a thin circular layer, mimicking the shape of a pizza crust.
1. Transfer to the oven to bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly golden brown.
1. Turn the heat down to 300 degrees F.
1. Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce atop the crust and a few pieces of mozzarella.
1. Transfer to the oven until the sauce is warm and cheese has melted, about 5 to 7 minutes.
1. Top with fresh basil and a few pinches of red pepper flakes.

## III- Preparation Notes:

* To combat sogginess, you can put a layer of cheese on first and then add the sauce and then more cheese.
