    1. Toss apple chunks with salt and cinnamon.
    1. In the bottom of your slow-cooker [mine is 7 quarts], mix brown and granulated sugars, then spread evenly to cover.
    1. Layer apples on top, keeping them in a single layer as much as possible, then adding the rest of top.
    1. Mix the crumble topping together in a bowl, using your fingers to distribute the butter evenly and thoroughly and clump it together.
    1. Sprinkle it over top of the apples.
    1. Cook apples on low for 4 hours, or high for 2 hours.
    1. Turn off heat, unplug, and let sit, covered, for one hour.
    1. During this time the caramel will thicken a bit more. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
