## I- Ingredients:
* 2 ears of corn, husks removed;
* 1 avocado, diced;
* 1 jalapeno, seeded and finely chopped;
* 1 tsp extra virgin olive oil;
* 1 pound flank steak;
* 1 tsp salt, divided;
* 1/4 tsp fresh cracked pepper.

## II- Directions:
1. Turn the burner on a stove to medium-high, and put corn on the burner. Rotate every few minutes, for about 5-10 minutes, until corn is slightly charred, set aside.
1. When cooled, cut corn off of the stalk and into a bowl.
1. Into the bowl add avocado and jalapeno and sprinkle with 1/2 tsp salt.
1. Sprinkle steak with about 1/4 tsp salt and a little pepper on each side, then let rest.
1. To a skillet, add olive oil and over medium-high heat allow it to warm up for 30 seconds.
1. Add the flank steak in and cook each side for about 4-5 minutes, or until a nice crust form.
1. Flank steak cooks quickly (depending on the thickness of the cut) so if you like it on the rarer side, cook it for 3-4 minutes.
1. When steak is cooked to doneness liking, remove from heat and let rest for 5 minutes before cutting it into pieces.
1. Serve steak over corn salad and enjoy!!
