## I- Ingredients:
* 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese with a sand consistency (don't use shredded or Microplaned Parmesan cheese)
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/4 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 1/2 lbs baby potatoes, halved (1.5-2 inch diameter; approx 20-22 potatoes)

## II- Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C ).
1. In a small bowl, combine grated cheese, garlic powder, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper, stirring with a fork until mixed.
1. Pour olive oil into 9'13 glass baking dish. Tilt dish around until olive oil evenly coats the entire bottom.
1. Carefully and evenly sprinkle cheese mixture over bottom of the pan. (Don't dump it in and then try to spread it out. Once it touches the olive oil, it becomes almost impossible to spread the cheese out evenly, it will clump. It works better to sprinkle slowly and evenly over the entire surface so that no spreading is necessary.)
1. Arrange potatoes in a single layer, cut side down, on top of cheese mixture. Press down to ensure potatoes are flat and in contact with a cheese layer.
1. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until cheese is browned and potatoes are soft when pressed or pierced with a fork.
1. Remove from oven and leave potatoes to rest in pan for 5 minutes. Remove potatoes from pan using a small spatula, being careful to keep the cheese layer intact on the cut side of the potato.
1. Arrange on serving platter cheese side up. Serve with sour cream or Greek yogurt, sprinkled with chopped scallions or chives, if desired.
