    1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
    1. In a small bowl, mix together cream of chicken soup, sour cream, garlic powder, salt & pepper, and about half of the cilantro. Set aside.
    1. In a lightly sprayed skillet on medium-high heat, add your chopped onions and garlic, and sauté until your onions are slightly translucent (about 3 minutes). Add in your diced chilies, chicken, cilantro, chili powder, salt and pepper and cook for about five more minutes, stirring all together.
    1. Take a couple tablespoons of the sour cream mixture and add to the chicken. Stir and mix completely.
    1. Divide and scoop the chicken mixture evenly onto each tortilla.
    1. Roll the tortillas up and place seam-side down in a lightly sprayed baking dish that has a tiny bit of the mixture spread on the bottom of the dish.
    1. Top with shredded cheese and bake for 25 minutes.
