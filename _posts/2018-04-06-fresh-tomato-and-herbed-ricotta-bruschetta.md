## I- Ingredients for  9 Bruschettas:

* 1 pint cherry tomatoes;
* 1 cup ricotta cheese;
* 1/4 cup spinach leaves (finely chopped);
* 2 Tbsp basil leaves (finely chopped);
* 1 Tbsp chives (finely chopped);
* 1 french bread (baguette, or similar artisan country bread, cut in ½ inch thick slices, 8-10 slices);
* 3 Tbsp olive oil;
* 2 garlic cloves (peeled and left whole);
* Salt;
* Pepper.

## II- Directions:

1. Cut cherry tomatoes in half. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
1. In a small mixing bowl combine ricotta cheese, spinach, basil and chives. 
1. Stir to combine thoroughly. Set aside.
1. Toast bread, in a toaster or under the broiler in the oven ( or on the grill if you like), until golden brown.
1. Rub toast vigorously with whole raw garlic clove. The rough surface of the bread helps shave the garlic clove. (approx. 2-3 strokes per slice of bread, add more or less to taste).
1. Drizzle or brush top side of toast with olive oil.
1. Assemble bruschetta by layering each piece of toast with ricotta mixture, and sliced tomatoes.
1. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and garnish with snipped chives and chopped basil.
