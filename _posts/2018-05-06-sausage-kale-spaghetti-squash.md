* 1 1/2 lbs. Italian chicken sausage, casings removed;
* 1 yellow onion, diced;
* 4 cloves garlic, minced;
* 1 bunch kale;
* 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling;
* Salt and pepper
* 2 tbsp pine nuts, roasted;
* 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped.

## II- Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

1. Place the halves, with the cut side up, on a rimmed baking sheet.

1. Meanwhile, prepare the kale by removing the center stems and either tearing or cutting up the leaves.
1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
1. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 4-5 minutes.
1. Add the chicken sausage and break apart with a spatula to crumble.
1. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring regularly, until the sausage is browned and cooked through.

1. Cook for a few minutes more to wilt the kale.
1. Remove from heat and set aside.
