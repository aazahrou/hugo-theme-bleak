    1. Line a 5-quart slow cooker with foil, and lightly coat with nonstick cooking spray.

    1. Stir in the coconut sugar, mixing until completely dissolved.
    1. Add in the flour mixture, stirring until just incorporated.
    1. Fold in the dark chocolate chips and 1 ½ tablespoons of miniature chocolate chips.
    1. Spread the cookie dough into the prepared slow cooker, and gently press the remaining miniature chocolate chips on top.
    1. Place the slow cooker lid on top.
    1. Cook on LOW for 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours 15 minutes, or until the sides look firm and set while the center still looks slightly underdone.
