## I- Ingredients for 4 servings:
* 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 4 pieces;
* 1/2 cup salsa;
* 1/2 cup pepper jack or a Mexican blend cheese (about 2 ounces), grated;
* 1 small onion, chopped;
* 1 bell pepper, sliced;
* Cooking spray;
* Splash of water (or oil, if you prefer);
* 1 15-ounce can of black beans or pinto beans, rinsed and drained;
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin;
* Juice of a lime;
* Salt & pepper to taste.

## II- Directions:
1. Peppers & Beans In a large skillet, cook the onion and peppers in a splash of water, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are cooked through but still crisp.
1. Add the beans, cumin and lime juice and heat through. Season to taste. Transfer the mixture to another dish, keep warm.
1. Cut the chicken breasts into individual servings. Between two pieces of waxed paper, pound the thickest part of the breast until each piece is roughly the same thickness throughout. Season with salt and pepper.
1. Spray the skillet with cooking spray, heat on medium high. Add the chicken pieces and let cook, without moving, for 3 to 4 minutes until crisp crust forms. With tongs, turn the pieces over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Spoon the Peppers & Beans around the chicken pieces, then cover the chicken with salsa and cheese.
1. Bake for 5 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly.
1. Sprinkle lime zest over top and serve.
