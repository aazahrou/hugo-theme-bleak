## I- Ingredients for 8 servings:

* 1 (16 ounce) box bow tie pasta;
* 4 Tbsp butter;
* 4 cloves garlic (finely minced or pressed through a garlic press);
* 1/2 Tbsp dried basil;
* 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese (softened and cut into small cubes);
* 1 (8 ounce) jar sun-dried tomatoes (rinsed, drained and chopped);
* 2 cups milk;
* 8 ounces Parmesan cheese (grated);
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper;
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (more to taste if needed);
* 1 cup chicken (cooked and cubed).

## II- Directions:

1. Cook pasta according to package directions. While it's cooking, prepare the sauce.
1. In a medium pot or skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
1. Add the garlic and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring the whole time.
1. Stir in the dried basil.
1. Add the cream cheese, stirring with a whisk until the mixture is smooth.
1. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes.
1. Keep cooking over medium heat and add the milk and whisk quickly and constantly until it is blended into the sauce.
1. Stir in the Parmesan cheese, pepper and salt.
1. Cook over medium heat, stirring until the cheese is melted and the sauce is the desired consistency, 5-10 minutes.
1. Serve over hot, cooked noodles. I put my chicken on top, or you can mix it in.

## III- Preparation Notes:

* When making them into freezer meals - put the noodles, sauce and chicken into two 9x9 foil tins.
* Wait until it cools down a little, place foil on top, and stick in the freezer.
* To cook when frozen: Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes or until heated through.
* To cook when frozen but then thawed: Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until heated through.
