## I- Ingredients for servings:

* 2 organic apple chicken sausage links, cooked;
* 2 whole scallions;
* 1 batch uncooked whole wheat pizza dough (Get it on Amazon <a href="https://amzn.to/2xf8N8R">Click Here</a>);
* 1 Tbs Olive Oil;
* 1/4 cup Cornmeal;
* 4 eggs;
* 2 cups of shredded white cheese;
* Dried Basil, Red Pepper Flakes, and Ground Black Pepper, to taste.

## II- Directions:

1. Slice chicken sausage into rounds and cut up your scallions (the green and the white parts). Place in a bowl and set aside.
1. On a clean surface, spread out cornmeal then place pizza dough on top. 
1. Roll out dough to desired consistency. Transfer dough to a greased cookie sheet then drizzle the top of the dough with olive oil.
1. Using a paper towel, rub oil evenly over crust.
1. Heat grill on medium-high heat. 
1. Flip crust onto grill so that the olive-oil side is down.
1. Close the lid and let cook about 1 minute, or until there are just slight grill marks on the bottom.
1. Flip crust and quickly crack 4 eggs over the crust – try to spread them out so each piece gets a bite of egg.
1. Cover and allow to cook 3-5 minutes, or until the eggs are almost set.
1. Once eggs are nearly set, cover pizza with cheese, sausage, scallions, and seasonings. Cover once more and cook 1-2 minutes, or until the cheese has melted.
1. Remove pizza from grill, slice and serve.
