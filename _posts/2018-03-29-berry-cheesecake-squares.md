## I- Ingredients for 24 Squares:

* 14 oz gingersnap cookies (crushed, I used Trader Joe’s Triple Ginger Snaps);
* 4 Tbsp butter (melted);
* 2 packages light cream cheese (225g each, at room temperature);
* 2/3 cup sugar;
* 2 eggs;
* 1/4 cup low-fat sour cream;
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon;
* 6 oz raspberries;
* 12 oz berries (assorted, for garnish).

## II- Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9x13 inch pan with parchment paper.
1. In a food processor, pulse gingersnap cookies until finely and evenly ground.
1. Add the melted butter and pulse until mixed. Transfer the mixture into the pan and press down firmly with your fingers. 
1. Bake the crust for 10 minutes. After the crust is done baking, reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.
1. With a mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth, about 2-3 minutes.
1. Add the sugar and mix until combined. Add eggs one at a time, mixing after each one. Mix in the sour cream and cinnamon.
1. In a food processor, puree 6 ounces of raspberries until liquefied.
1. Strain the puree, discarding the seeds. Add the remaining liquid to the ingredients in the mixer, and mix until combined.
1. Pour the mixture over the baked crust, and return to the oven for 30 minutes. It’s okay if the middle is still slightly wiggly, but the edges should be set.
1. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate at least 3-4 fours before cutting.
1. Once chilled, carefully remove the cheesecake from the pan by lifting up the parchment paper.
1. Cut into 24 pieces (4 by 6) and top with assorted berries.
