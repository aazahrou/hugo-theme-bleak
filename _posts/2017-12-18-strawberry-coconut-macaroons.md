## I- Ingredients for 19 Macaroons:

* 4 large egg whites;
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar;
* 1 tsp vanilla extract;
* 1/2 tsp almond extract;
* 4 and 3/4 cups sweetened shredded coconut;
* 1/2 cup diced strawberries.

## II- Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 325°F (162°C).
1. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
1. Use an oven thermometer to test your oven temperature. The degree point must be precise.
1. In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the egg whites, sugar, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until foamy and the sugar is mostly dissolved &#8211; at least 2 minutes.
1. Fold in the coconut, making sure the coconut is evenly moistened. The mixture will be wet and sticky.
1. Cover the mixture tightly with plastic wrap and allow to sit covered in the refrigerator for 30 minutes so the coconut can absorb some of the liquid.
1. Meanwhile, pat your diced strawberries dry with a paper towel. You don&#8217;t want them too wet. Gently fold the strawberries into the coconut mixture.
1. Using a large cookie scoop, scoop 2 Tablespoons of the mixture and place onto prepared baking sheet &#8211; at least 2 inches apart.
1. Make sure the mounds are very compact and neat, as pictured above.
1. Bake until lightly golden brown, about 20-22 minutes.
1. Make sure to rotate the pan to ensure even baking. Otherwise, some tops may burn.
1. Allow cooling completely on the baking sheets before enjoying.
1. Cover leftover macaroons tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days or 3 days at room temperature.
