## I- Ingredients for 24 Wonton Bites:

* 1 lb of chicken breasts, cooked and chopped;
* 2 scallions, chopped;
* 3 tbsp cilantro or parsley, chopped;
* 1 tbsp fresh lime juice;
* 2 tsp green curry paste;
* 2 tbsp mayonnaise;
* 1 tbsp coconut milk;
* 24 wonton wrappers (about half a 12oz package);
* vegetable oil, for brushing;
* salt;
* snipped chives, for garnish.

## II- Directions:

1. Make the green curry chicken salad by mixing to combine the chopped chicken, scallions, cilantro or parsley, lime juice, green curry paste, mayonnaise, and coconut milk. Let this mixture sit in the fridge for at least an hour, so the flavors meld. If you can even make this a day ahead of time, the flavors will be optimal the next day.

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
1. Brush each wonton wrapper with vegetable oil on both sides, then nestle it into the bottom of a 12-cup mini muffin pan. Repeat until the pan is filled, then sprinkle the wonton wrappers with salt. Bake for 10 minutes, until the wontons get golden brown and crispy. Let them cool down on a wire rack, and repeat with the remaining 12 wonton wrappers, so you have 24 wonton cups total.

1. Once the wonton cups have cooled down, fill each one with a heaping pile of the green curry chicken salad. And be generous here! Garnish with snipped chives, and serve!
